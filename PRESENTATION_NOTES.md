# Presentation Notes

## Git
 * Hipchat is a hook
 * You can remove sensitive info: https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data

## Node
 * All JavaScript.  Everyone can go full stack.
 * Popular editors:
   * ```Sublime Text 2```
   * ```Vim```
   * ```WebStorm```
   * ```Aptana Studio```
 * ```Nodemon``` is cool, allows auto-restarts when files are saved.

## Frameworks
 * We selected ```Express``` as opposed to some sockety thing (eg. Socket.IO) because we actually may want to build an app with this technology.  Also ```Heroku``` doesn't do sockets yet.  We would have used ```AppFog``` or ```Nodejitsu``` instead.

## Templating Language
 * We started out ```Jade```.  Really stripped down syntax.
 * Switched to ```Handlebars```.  Syntax is more familiar and easier to pick up in this short period.

## Styles
 * We are using ```Stylus``` instead of CSS.  Allows for variables.
